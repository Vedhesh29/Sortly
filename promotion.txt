Hey everyone,
I got tired of my Downloads folder constantly turning into a mess, so I put together a little utility app called Sortly.
It’s a Windows tool that automatically organizes files into folders based on file type. For example, PDFs into a PDFs folder, images into an Images folder, installers, music, you get the idea.
You can:
Customize which file types go where
Set subfolders by year or music genre
Undo the last sort if you change your mind
I priced it at $3 on Gumroad and itch.io to cover my time. If anyone wants to check it out or support it, the links are down below. 
Totally get if it’s not for everyone, just thought some folks here might find it useful!
Happy to answer any questions or get feedback.
